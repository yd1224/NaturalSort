# Difference Between External Natural Merge Sort and Modified External Natural Sort

The main difference between **External Natural Merge Sort** and **Modified External Natural Sort** lies in how they handle data and the amount of data they are designed to process. Both are types of external sorting algorithms, which are used when the data is too large to fit into memory and must be sorted using external storage (like disks). Below is a breakdown of the differences:

## 1. External Natural Merge Sort (for small amounts of data)

- **Purpose**: Typically used for sorting small datasets that, while too large to fit entirely in memory, do not exceed the system's available resources by much.
- **Process**:
  - The data is divided into chunks that fit into memory.
  - Each chunk is sorted individually using an internal sorting algorithm (like quicksort or mergesort).
  - After sorting the chunks, the algorithm performs a natural merge operation where it merges the sorted chunks.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Requires less optimization because the chunks are small enough to be efficiently managed using traditional merge sort and memory paging.
  - More suitable for situations where the data size is large, but still manageable with limited resources.
- **Performance**: Since the number of chunks is smaller, the merging process is less complex and quicker.

## 2. Modified External Natural Sort (for large amounts of data)

- **Purpose**: This modification is designed for cases where the dataset is significantly large and the cost of merging becomes more complex due to the larger number of chunks.
- **Process**:
  - Similar to the standard external natural merge sort, data is initially divided into chunks.
  - Each chunk is sorted, but the merging process is modified to be more efficient by leveraging better memory management and disk I/O optimization techniques.
  - The key difference is in the merge strategy, where the algorithm may involve more sophisticated buffering and merging techniques (e.g., k-way merging instead of the usual 2-way).
- **Efficiency**:
  - Optimized for handling larger datasets by minimizing the number of disk reads and writes, and potentially overlapping sorting and merging operations to improve overall throughput.
  - Uses more advanced techniques like prefetching, caching, and efficient data access patterns.
- **Performance**: The merging process becomes more efficient with better memory utilization and optimized disk access, but the overall process involves more complexity than a standard external sort.

## Key Differences:

1. **Data Size**:
   - External Natural Merge Sort is designed for smaller amounts of data that are manageable with minimal optimizations.
   - Modified External Natural Sort is specifically optimized for large datasets, using more advanced techniques to improve efficiency.

2. **Merging Strategy**:
   - External Natural Merge Sort uses simpler two-way merges.
   - Modified External Natural Sort uses more complex merging strategies like k-way merges to reduce I/O operations.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Modified External Natural Sort includes optimizations to handle the increased number of chunks and the greater I/O cost that comes with larger data volumes.

In summary, while both algorithms are used for external sorting, the **Modified External Natural Sort** is a more advanced and optimized version, better suited for handling larger datasets, where the number of chunks and I/O operations becomes a bottleneck.
